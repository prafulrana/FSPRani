# FSP Rani - Real-time Ball Tracking iOS App

A high-performance iOS app that uses YOLOv8m for real-time ball detection with Metal-accelerated rendering.

## Features

- **30 FPS Real-time Detection** - Smooth ball tracking without frame drops
- **No Distortion Pipeline** - Full camera view with 1:1 pixel mapping
- **Color-Coded Object Detection** - Visual identification of different object types:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Sports Ball (Green)
  - ðŸ”µ Person (Blue)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Chair (Yellow)
  - ðŸŸ  Skateboard (Orange)
  - ðŸŸ£ Other Objects (Various colors)

- **Pure Pipeline Architecture** - Every frame processed through YOLO model
- **Metal Shader Rendering** - GPU-accelerated YUV to RGB conversion with detection overlay
- **Full Screen Experience** - Optimized for iPhone with proper letterboxing

## Technical Stack

- **Model**: YOLOv8m (CoreML optimized)
- **Framework**: Vision + Metal
- **Rendering**: Single-pass Metal shader pipeline
- **Performance**: ANE (Apple Neural Engine) accelerated
